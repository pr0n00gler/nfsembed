# End-to-end certification suite

`tests/run_ci.sh` is the repository-level gate intended for future Linux and
macOS CI jobs. The integration tests use only the public embedded-server API
and communicate with the server over real TCP RPC record streams.

| Suite | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| `e2e_protocol.rs` | Exact successful wire results for all 22 NFSv3 procedures, all MOUNTv3 procedures, AUTH_SYS context propagation, WCC, create modes, durability, cookies, and pagination |
| `e2e_errors.rs` | Every NFSv3 result-union failure shape, all-procedure truncation and trailing-field rejection, invalid discriminants, field limits, RPC mismatch ranges, and authentication policies |
| `e2e_runtime.rs` | Replay hit/wait/lost-reply/XID-generation/TTL/count/byte-budget behavior, authenticated handle isolation, multiple exports, inline and standalone TCP/UDP portmapper including oversized-datagram recovery, transport-aware transfer limits, aggregate request/reply byte budgets, execution and socket-progress timeouts, slow-reader eviction, concurrency, graceful lifecycle, reconnects, read-only and case policies |
| `e2e_adversarial.rs` | Fragmentation corpus, authentication prefix corpus, WRITE truncation and length corpus, READDIR/READDIRPLUS size sweep, and per-byte file-handle forgery corpus |
| `e2e_observability.rs` | Stable tracing fields and events plus negative checks for file-content and AUTH_SYS machine-name leakage |
| `e2e_load.rs` | Sustained multi-connection request/mutation load with concurrency, completion-time, operation-count, and Linux RSS-growth thresholds |
| `fuzz/` | cargo-fuzz targets for bounded XDR, AUTH_SYS, RPC records, handles, production WRITE decoding/validation, production READDIR sizing/encoding, and concurrent replay transitions |
| `native/` | Persistent privileged Linux/macOS kernel-client workload covering all NFSv3/MOUNTv3 procedure numbers, multi-megabyte I/O, namespace mutation verification, pagination, concurrency, reconnect, restart, read-only and case-policy profiles, plus same- and cross-host runners |

Run the platform-executable portion in a cached Linux toolchain container with
networking disabled. Formatting and Clippy remain part of the host/CI toolchain
gate because minimal Rust images may not contain those optional components:

```sh
docker run --rm --network none \
  -v "$PWD:/work:ro" \
  -v "$HOME/.cargo/registry:/usr/local/cargo/registry:ro" \
  -w /work \
  -e CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/tmp/target \
  rust:1.90-bookworm \
  sh -c 'cargo test --all-targets && cargo test --all-features --all-targets'
```

The standard gate also builds and smoke-runs every cargo-fuzz target. Native
privileged mount interoperability is implemented by `tests/native/` and the
`native-client.yml` workflow. Linux and macOS runners launch the same embedded
certification server, mount using
`vers=3,tcp,port=<port>,mountport=<port>`, execute the shared workload, then
unmount. A Lima Linux VM on the `macos-15-intel` runner automatically covers both
cross-host directions on every pull request and push; no external endpoint is
required. The library itself never performs mount execution or privilege
elevation.
